November 2024 :
I created this repo as I needed to learn text mining for my work at NUS. The recommended book had been published about 5 years ago and needed revision. I try to stuck to the book's content as much as I can.

1. All uploaded coding scripts were tested to ensure they run successfully.

2. If the output of my code differ from the book's, it may be due to updates in the datasets sometime after the book was problished.

3. Feel free to reach out to me if you have feedback on my code: rtraining.help@gmail.com

I hope you find my code helpful!
