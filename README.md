This repo was created for any one who is learning text mining. A good resource to start is "Text Mining with R" (2017-06-08 First Release), but the original R codes had some errors. I added comments to code which helped in my understanding of text mining. 

You can also find the latest code on the author David's GitHub page (https://github.com/dgrtwo/tidy-text-mining).

2. All uploaded coding scripts were tested in R Studio "Ocean Storm" Release (4da58325, 2024-01-29) for macOS. My system is a Mac OS Sonoma 14.5. For Chapters 1 to 5, the scripts were tested on R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) -- "Eye Holes"). For Chapter 6 onwards, the script was tested on R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29) -- "Angel Food Cake") in the same R Studio version.

3. Besides Chapter 8 which uses a live jSON connection, the datasets are either from the abovementioned author's GitHub page or from Project Gutenberg, a library of free eBooks. The website's url of Project Gutenberg is: https://www.gutenberg.org
