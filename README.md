1. All uploaded coding scripts were tested to ensure they run successfully.

2. If the output of my code differ from the book's, it may be due to updates in the datasets sometime after the book was problished.

3. Feel free to reach out to me if you have feedback on my code: rtraining.help@gmail.com

I hope you find my code helpful!
