November 2024 : \
I created this repo as I needed to learn text mining for my work at NUS. The recommended book had been published about 7 years ago and the code printed on the physical copy (2017-06-08 First Release) needed revision. In my code, I try to adhere to the book's code output as much as I can.

1. The work by Julia Silge and David Robinson is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License.

2. All uploaded coding scripts were tested to ensure they run successfully.

3. If the output of my code differ from the book's, it may be due to updates in the datasets sometime after the book was problished. At this point (end of Chapter 4), besides datasets that came with the packages, the other datasets are from Project Gutenberg, a library of free eBooks. The website's url is: https://www.gutenberg.org

4. Feel free to reach out to me if you have feedback on my code. My email address is: rtraining.help@gmail.com

I hope you find my code helpful. - czhd-create
