November 2024 : \
I created this repo to run the code printed on the book. I was learning text mining. The recommended book had been published about 7 years ago and the code printed on the physical copy (2017-06-08 First Release) had some errors. You can find the latest code on the authors' GitHub pages. Here, I try to reproduce the book's code output as much as I can, using the book's code as a learning tool.

2. All uploaded coding scripts were tested in R Studio "Ocean Storm" Release (4da58325, 2024-01-29) for macOS. My system is a Mac OS Sonoma 14.5. For Chapters 1 to 5, the scripts were tested on R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) -- "Eye Holes"). For Chapter 6 onwards, the script was tested on R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29) -- "Angel Food Cake") in the same R Studio version.

3. If the output of my code differ from the book's, it may be due to updates in the datasets sometime after the book was problished. At this point (end of Chapter 4), besides datasets that came with the packages, the other datasets are either from the author's GitHub pages or from Project Gutenberg, a library of free eBooks. The website's url is: https://www.gutenberg.org

I hope you find my code helpful. - czhd-create
